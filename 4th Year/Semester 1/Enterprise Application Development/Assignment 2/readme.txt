If you press the arrow in the datatable it will archive that property. 
You can then press "View Archived Properties" where you will have an option to permanently delete the property or unarchive it.  

"View My Properties" will display only the current user's properties. 

There is only a basic filter as I ran out of time. You have to enter a minimum price, max price and a city. 
It will then display properties that match this. 

I did not get image uploading to work. You can stil create new properties and click the broken image link to look at the drill down
of the property details.

The property details page will dynamically display the location of whatever property you create based on the address. 

Guest users can view all properties, filter and click click into the property drilldown. They cannot edit or archive properties. 

I unfortunately did not get the project completed. 
The closest thing to a unique feature would be the archiving/deleting functionality.
