Glenbarrow Loops

Enjoy enchanting forest walks and hidden valleys in the heart of County Laois.

Glenbarrow is the source of the River Barrow, the second longest river in Ireland. The Barrow is one of the three sisters with 
the River Nore and the River Suir making up the others. The Barrow enters the sea in Waterford, 120 miles away.
Glenbarrow is one of the most scenic parts of the Slieve Bloom area with its waterfalls and steep valley. 
The area is very remote and offers the visitor peace and tranquillity. The only sounds to be heard are the 
crash of the waterfalls and the fast flowing Barrow.

Glenbarrow is a unique forest setting with a beautiful riverside walk. Therefore the terrain can be rough in parts and sometimes 
wet underfoot so be prepared with appropriate clothing and footwear.

The area has four way-marked marked trails. The trails all start at the car park and all follow the river for the first section. 
The four trails are:

Flat Rock loop 
Waterfall loop
Old Mill loop
