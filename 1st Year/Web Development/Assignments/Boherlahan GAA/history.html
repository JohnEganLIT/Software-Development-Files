  <p>The Mid Tipperary G.A.A. Board was founded in 1907 but Boherlahan, as a club, did not come into existence until 1912.
  Its first chairman was Tommy O'Dwyer. Though Boherlahan contested the Mid final in 1912 they were defeated by the Thurles 
  &quot;Blues&quot; but in the following year, 1913, they defeated The Jockey 5-4 to 1-0 for their first Mid title. 
  Boherlahan won successive Mid titles up until 1919, except for 1915 when our club opted into the south division 
  and took the county title as well as the south title that year. Boherlahan again opted for the south division during the 
  decade 1924 to 1934 so their next mid success was 1941 when Philly O'Dwyer led a team powered by Mahers, Coffeys, 
  O'Dwyers and Loobys to mid and county success. Surviving members of that team are John, Flor Coffey, and Ned O'Dwyer.</p>
  
  <p>Twelve unsuccessful years were to follow but in 1953 they again took the mid title defeating Sarsfields at Templemore. 
  Similar success wasn't repeated until 1995 when they defeated rivals Loughmore to take the Corn Sheain Ui Laochda home to 
  Tubberadora for the first time. The trophy (presented by the Leahy family to the division forty years previously) has not 
  been regained since, as the club lost in 1996 and 1997 to Sarsfields and Holycross respectively.</p>
  
  <p>Having been beaten in the 1995 by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nenagh_Eire_Og_GAA" title="Nenagh Eire Og GAA" 
  wotsearchprocessed="true">Nenagh Eire Og GAA</a> which motivated the team to regroup and again challenge for the ultimate 
  prize in Tipperary Senior hurling, Boherlahan was to be victories in the 1996 County Final in which a very talented team 
  captained by Goalkeeper Philly Ryan was successful against <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toomevara_GAA" 
  title="Toomevara GAA" wotsearchprocessed="true">Toomevara GAA</a> on a scoreline of 1-16 to 2-12. Future success was expected 
  to follow however this did not happen and the club was to remain very competitive however no major success was to be achieved. 
  Most of the players involved in the 1996 team have now retired from senior hurling with some notable exceptions who remain vital 
  parts of the senior club at both senior and junior codes, others are now involved in training teams and also the management of teams.</p>
